# Pandas Challenge: PyCity Schools

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create and organize Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data, and discover relevant trends that derive from the analysis. In particular, the analysis was conducted on high school students' math and reading scores, and other information on the schools that they attend.

The following metrics were calculated using python coding:
- Total(max) values
- Mean values of math and reading scores
- Percentages of math, reading and overall scores

Furthermore, a DataFrame was created that summarized these metrics about each school. Then, other DataFrames were created for the following:
- Highest Performing Schools, by overall passing grade
- Lowest Performing Schools, by overall passing grade
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type
